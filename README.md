2. [ ] Solve three to five python challenges which are '`7kyu`'
3. [ ] Choose and complete a project from the projects list.


### Week 4

To be added.

## Projects

- [ ] Create a module that checks if a haiku is following proper format (5-7-5 syllable pattern)
- [ ] Create a slackbot (HTTP server) for rolling dice via `/roll`.
- [ ] Create a module  that calculates statistical methods. (Mean, Median, Mode, standard deviation, and variance.
- [ ] Create a module that outputs the Fibonnacci Sequence up to `n` terms. `n` should default to 100.
- [ ] Create a module with two functions, one which parses and compiles markdown into html, and the other jade into html.
