**Estimating an initial 10 hours of study per week.**

### Week 0

If you know programming already, **skip week 0**.

You can `clone` or `fork` this repository to use it as a checklist; tracking progress as you go.

If you are starting on week 0, skip any tasks that are repeated in later weeks&mdash;or&mdash;use them as an oppurtunity for review.

5. [ ] Choose and complete a project from the projects list.

### Week 3

Project Week

1. [ ] Review the table of contents of [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). Look for language facets that you do not recognize, and read their entries. Cross-reference with python documentation, if needed.
2. [ ] Solve three to five python challenges which are '`7kyu`'
3. [ ] Choose and complete a project from the projects list.


### Week 4

_Challenges Week._

1. [ ] Solve as many python challenges which as possible to achieve '`7kyu`'/'`6kyu`'/'`5kyu`' rank on codewars.
2. [ ] Choose and complete a project from the projects list.

## Projects

- [ ] Create a module that checks if a haiku is following proper format (5-7-5 syllable pattern)
- [ ] Create a slackbot (HTTP server) for rolling dice via `/roll`.
- [ ] Create a module  that calculates statistical methods. (Mean, Median, Mode, standard deviation, and variance.
- [ ] Create a module that outputs the Fibonnacci Sequence up to `n` terms. `n` should default to 100.
- [ ] Create a module with two functions, one which parses and compiles markdown into html, and the other jade into html.
